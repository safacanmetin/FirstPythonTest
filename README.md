- "unittest" is a built-in Python module used for creating and running tests
- "TestFactorial" is a new test class that inherits from "unittest.TestCase". By inheriting from "unittest.TestCase", you gain access to various testing methods and assertions provided by the unittest framework.
- "test_calculate_factorial" is a test method within the "TestFactorial" class. Test methods are functions where you write the actual test logic.
- "self.assertEqual": This assertion checks if the result is equal to the expected_output. If they are not equal, the test will fail and indicate that the function's behavior is different from what is expected.
